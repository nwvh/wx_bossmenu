## This is a simple bossmenu script meant to be used with esx_society that uses ox_lib. It works, but it's not complete, it can be used in production, as it features the most essential boss menu functions:

- Hire players
- Kick Players
- Demote/Promote players
- View employee list

## TODO:

- Manage society balance
- Payout employees
- Manage salaries
