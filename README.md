As the name says, it's a carlock script that uses one simple ESX callback to the database. It includes a big config file where you can modify almost EVERYTHING, without even opening the source code! You can enable/disable settings or even translate the whole script in ONE config file! And the OX_LIB part? I've used ox_lib's notifications and progress bars, but you can replace them if you like. The script is OPEN SOURCE on my GitHub 
"# !! [WIP] !! Works, but it's not complete"
